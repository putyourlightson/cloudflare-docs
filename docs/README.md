# Cloudflare Plugin for Craft CMS

![Cloudflare](../resources/hero.svg)

This plugin makes it possible to purge Cloudflare caches directly from Craft CMS. You can initiate purges manually, either for individual URLs or an entire zone, and configure the plugin to automatically purge Entry and Asset URLs when theyâ€™re updated.
