# Overview

## Manually Purging Caches

You can manually purge individual URLs or the entire zone, either from the plugin settings page or via the convenient _Cloudflare Purge_ Dashboard widget, whose function is identical but with a more elegant facade.

## Automatically Purge URLs

You can use the previously-mentioned _Automatically Purge Entry URLs_ and _Automatically Purge Asset URLs_ settings to proactively clear caches on specific URLs immediately after actions are taken in the control panel. You can also use simple pattern rules to clear specific URLs. (See _Rule-Based Purging_ below.)
